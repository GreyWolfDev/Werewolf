  <string key="AboutVG">
    <value>Your role is simple - try to survive. Each day, you will have a chance to lynch the werewolf.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSeer">
    <value>You are the Seer. Each night, you may choose a player, and have their role revealed to you. Admit to your role wisely: If you reveal you are the seer, the wolves will try to kill you!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWw">
    <value>You get to have fun! Each day, you will attempt to deceive your fellow players. However, each night, you will get to pick a player to kill!\nNote: If you attack the cursed, they will become a wolf like yourself! Hooray friends!\nIf you attack the drunk, you yourself will become drunk, and will be unable to do the next attack as you sleep off your hangover! (Usually, this means you can't attack the following night, but if the Wolf Cub was killed and the Drunk was your first choice, you won't be able to kill the second player, and you will still be able to attack the following night.) </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHarlot">
    <value>As the harlot (you slut...) you will be given the chance to 'visit' another player each night. If they are not the wolf, you will be told so (because you live!). If you visit a wolf, you will be killed. If you visit the player the wolves have chosen to kill, you will be killed as well. However - If you are visiting a player, and the wolves choose to kill you, you will survive (you weren't home)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDrunk">
    <value>You drunken bastard! As the drunk, you are still just a villager. BUT! If the wolves kill you, they will become disabled for the next kill, as they are drunk off your insanely high BAC.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCursed">
    <value>As the cursed, you are a normal villager... until the wolves kill you. Once they do, you will become a wolf as well! Free to hunt in the night... XD</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTraitor">
    <value>You are a traitorous bastard. If you survive long enough for all the wolves to die, you will become a werewolf, ready to kill your former teammates in the night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGA">
    <value>You are the Guardian Angel! Each night, you may choose a player to watch over. Be careful however - if you choose to watch over a wolf, there is a 50% chance you will be killed.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDetective">
    <value>You old sleuth. Each day, you will have the chance to investigate another player. Use this carefully however, for these is a 40% chance the werewolves will detect you!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGunner">
    <value>A bit trigger happy are we? As the gunner, you are given 2 silver bullets at the beginning of the game. Each day, you will have the chance to shoot another player. Once you do, everyone will know you are the gunner! Be careful though, you only have 2 bullets!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTanner">
    <value>The Tanners goal is simple: Get Lynched. If the Tanner gets lynched, he wins, period. Everyone else loses.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutFool">
    <value>he fool is told they are the seer.... when they choose to see someone's role at night, they are told a random role.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCult">
    <value>As a cultist, it is your goal to convert all other players (except wolves) to your cult. If at the end of the game, all living players are cultist - the cult wins</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCH">
    <value>Your job is to hunt the Cult. If the cult attacks you, their newest member will die. Each night you may pick a player to 'hunt' - if they are a cultist, they will die.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWC">
    <value>At the beginning of the game, you will choose someone to be your 'role model'. If they die, you become a werewolf.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAppS">
    <value>For now, you are a normal villager. However, if the seer dies, you will become the new seer</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBH">
    <value>You will be told who the seer is (the real one, not the fool)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMason">
    <value>A mason's job is simple - they automatically know who the other masons are. Otherwise, they are a simple villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDG">
    <value>
      Your ancestors had the ability to metamorph into others... while you don't have their full abilities, you can pick a player at the start of the game. If that player dies, you will become what they were.
      Note: If the player was converted to cult, you will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were Wild Child and their role model died, you will become a wolf. Otherwise, you will inherit their role model.
      The cult cannot convert the Doppelgänger (but can after the doppelganger switches roles). Also - the Doppelgänger can NOT win unless they have transformed. If at the end of the game, the Doppelgänger is still the same, they lose (exception: lover)
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCupid">
    <value>
      Love is in the air. As Cupid, you will choose two players at the start of the game. These two players will become madly in love! If one of them dies, the other will die of sorrow :(
      Note: Lovers will know who each other are, but not be told their roles. If the lovers are the last two alive, they win, regardless of teams. If the lovers are on different teams (villager + wolf), and one team wins (wolf), the lover (villager) wins as well. TL;DR if at least one of the lovers was on the winning team, they both win together.
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>
      A trigger happy, vindictive player. As the hunter, you try to keep to yourself. However, when others come to visit you, they may find themselves dead, as your paranoia takes hold and you shoot. If the wolves attack you, you have a chance to take one of them with you. Otherwise, if you die, you will get a chance to shoot someone as you die.
      Note: For wolf attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one wolf, the hunter has a 30% chance to kill the wolf (and survive). For each additional wolf, add 20% (2 wolves = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple wolves, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed.
      If the cult tries to convert you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSK">
    <value>That asylum was silly anyways. What a joke. You are free now however, back to business as usual - killing! The serial killer is a lone player, on their own team. They can win only if they are the last player alive (exception: lovers). As the serial killer, you can kill ANYONE - wolves, hunters, gunners, guardian angels, whatever. If the wolves try to attack you, you will kill one of them (random), and live.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutPara">
    <value>Para is a silly developer that likes to bark at people.  Maybe he's been messing with werewolves too long....Messing with werewolves is a very bad idea.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMayor">
    <value>As mayor, you are a lowly villager, until you reveal yourself. Then you are given twice the vote count for lynching (meaning that your vote is twice as powerful as everyone else's). Use that power wisely to help the Village Team.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutPrince">
    <value>The prince is a key role in the Village Team's strategy. Once the prince gets lynched, their role as Prince is revealed, and they survive. However, this can only happen once: if the village insists on lynching them, they will die.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSorcerer">
    <value>Do you remember the good old seer? Well now, it has its Wolf Team counterpart. The sorcerer is the Wuff's Seer. They can only see if someone is Wolf or Seer, and they win with the Wolves.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutClumsy">
    <value>You are the Clumsy Guy. Maybe you should not have had so much alcohol for breakfast. You can't see a damn thing. Can you even vote for the person you want to? (You have a 50% chance to vote for someone random.)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBlacksmith">
    <value>
      You are the BlackSmith. Through the years, no blades nor swords gave you as much satisfaction as the Silver Blades the elves ordered.\nYou might have some silverdust left. Who knows ? It might *prevent Wolves from eating tonight* 🤔
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAlphaWolf">
 <value> You are the Alpha Wolf, the origin of the curse, the bane of banes. Every night, there's 20% chance that you will bite your pack's meal, and they will join your ranks instead of dying!</value>
 </string>
  <string key="AboutWolfCub">
    <value>What a cuuuute little wuff. _tickles tickles_ -cough cough- As i was saying, you are the Wolf Cub and you _drops the mic_ -I just can't resist that. I think if anyone killed you, I'd give the wuffs two victims. You're too cute to die. I wouldn't be able to tickle you anymore-</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWolfMan">
    <value>You are a lowly villager, but since you spend most of your time in the woods where there are real wolves, the Seer will get confused and think you are a werewolf! Oh no....</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutLycan">
    <value>The lycan is a wolf, but will appear to be a villager to the seer</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutOracle">
    <value>The oracle will be told what role someone is NOT, choosing from roles that are still alive in the game</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSandman">
    <value> Once per game, the sandman can make all players sleep so deeply that nobody can use their night actions</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutPacifist">
    <value>The Pacifist can choose to convince everyone in your village not to lynch anyone. This can only be done once.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWiseElder">
    <value>The Wise Elder 📚 can survive a werewolf attack once - the second time they can eat you up. If the Gunner or Hunter kill you with their abilities, they will lose their powers out of sorrow and will be converted to a normal villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutThief">
    <value>By default, the Thief 😈 can steal a player's role on the first night and turn that player into a villager.\nIf the [Full Thief] mode is turned on, they get 50% chance to steal a player's role every night, if successful, that player will become the new thief and continues with the theft!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTroublemaker">
	<value>The Troublemaker is the raging teenager in town. When they start yelling, the whole village gets out of control. To gain silence, they will lynch twice that day!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutChemist">
	<value>The chemist is a quite crazy person who likes to brew potions and mess up with them. They mix two potions and force other people to choose one to drink, while the chemist will drink the other. However, while one solution is just tasting like rosebuds, the other one is going to kill you instantly. Good luck when they visit you!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSnowWolf">
    <value>The Snow Wolf 🐺☃️ is an wolf that was native to the snowcapped mountains near the village. As such, they have mastered the art of controlling ice and snow. Having lived alone for a long time, the Snow Wolf prefers to operate alone. Instead of hunting with their pack at night, they can pick a separate victim to freeze, which causes them to be unable to use their night actions. However, they will still have some residue of the Snow Wolf's magic the next night, causing them to be immune to the Snow Wolf for one night. </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGraveDigger">
	<value>You are the Grave Digger ☠️. Every night, you dig the graves for all the people who died since the last time you did (yes, even werewolves deserve a proper burial). Since you are out all night, wolves and the cult can't find you, unless you actually have nothing to do (i.e. no one died), in that case you'll just stay home. Everyone who visits you has a chance of falling into your newly dug graves, depending on how many graves you dug. Also, the chance is halved for everyone who is on the village team with you. But since you are out at night, the wolves or the serial killer might spot and kill you, and the more graves you have to dig, the more likely it is. Also, apparently the serial killer can find you whether you're at home or not, but he might at least stumble in one of your graves and hurt his leg, causing him to maybe lose control over who is his victim the next night...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutArsonist">
	<value>You are the arsonist. Like the serial killer, you are alone on your team. Every night, you may douse one targets house with kerosene. Once one or more houses are doused, you may choose to spark instead, burning all doused houses and killing everyone that is inside, including potential visitors. You win if you're the only one left.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAugur">
	<value>You are the Augur 🦅. Every morning, you watch the birds and deduce a role that certainly is not in the game right now from their flight. They also will never tell you a role twice, so be sure you make use of that information!</value>

  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoDetective">
    <value>You are the Warlock 🕵! You used to be a part of Halloween Town's only coven, but some disagreements happened and they asked to leave... You can still use the soul-searching spells you learned in your former coven, just... not at the same time. The witches sleep during the day, so that's the time you can use your spells to find out exactly what kind of monster another person is! Be careful whenever the sun is out-- the walls have ears, and werewolves' heightened hearing may notice you preparing your spells!</value>
  </string>
   <string key="RoleInfoDrunk">
    <value>You are the Clurichaun 🍻! You are the alcohol-loving cousin of the Leprechaun. Your strong love for drinking gave you tendencies to haunt breweries, pubs and wine cellars.</value>

  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoGunner">
    <value>You are the Centaur 🔫. You lived for many years in the woods so you learned how to use the ark. In Halloween Town they allowed you to keep two arrows with you, so if something happens with other monsters you can use those arrows to defend yourself.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoHarlot">
    <value>You are the Succubus 💋! Every night, you go to someone's den and feed on their energy... which sounds wonderful. But it won't be if the monster you choose to feed on isn't very open to visitors. Still, a girl's gotta eat, right?</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoTraitor">
    <value>You are the Faceless 🖕! You're the faceless guy in town and you aren’t a good person but for now you will stay in the good team. It is your lifelong dream to become a werewolf but you can’t do it if other wolves are alive because they won’t accept you. You will have to wait until all wolves have died to replace them and steal their face.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoWolf">
    <value>You are a Werewolf 🐺! Back in the day you lived peacefully with the other monsters at Halloween Town, but something happened a while ago that made werewolves become violent and stronger...

  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoSeer" >
    <value >You are the Witch 👳! The head of Halloween Town's coven, you are the only one that has enough power to use soul-searching spells. Those spells take time, so you will only be able to search the soul of one monster each night to find out what they are!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoVillager" >

    <value >You are a Cerberus 👶! You are a guardian in this town and you have to choose a monster to protect.

  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoBeholder" >
    <value >You are the Black Cat 👁, and witches are known for having one as their familiar. If there is a Witch in this town, you will be its personal pet and you will know their identity.</value>

    <value >You are a Vampire 👤. Every night, you and your clan can choose one person to attack... Not that you'll kill them!

The more the merrier!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoCultistHunter" >
    <value >You are the Vampire Slayer 💂, trying to stop the vampires in town from converting everyone! Each night, you get to choose a player. If they are a vampire, they will die. If the vampires try to visit you, the vampire's newest member dies.</value>

  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoDoppelganger">
    <value>You are a Shapeshifter 🎭! Unfortunately, too many pranks have left you with a strict rule: no shifting into someone from the Town!

  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoWolfMan">
    <value>You are the Bigfoot 👱🌚. A very very very hairy monster, just like the werewolves. The main thing that makes you different from them is that you are not a carnivore.

	<value>You are the Goblin 😈! An ugly green creature that only loves to steal things just for the fun of it. In this Halloween Town, you love to steal the identity and the soul of other players.
