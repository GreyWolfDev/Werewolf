  <string key="RoleInfoCursed">
    <value>You are a coward (cursed 😾). If the HDB agents (wolves) ever try to evict you, you will turn over a new leaf and start evicting those you used to work with in illegal enterprise!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoDetective">
    <value>You are the drone operator (detective 🕵). During the day, you may fly a drone to snoop on a resident (no nude pictures!). However, there is a 40% chance of the HDB agents (wolves) noticing an illegal drone outside!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoDrunk">
    <value>You are the drunkard (drunk 🍻). If the HDB agents (wolves) must trail you all the way to Bedok Reservoir (while drowning your sorrows at losing huge bets due to José Mourinho), the HDB agents will still need to visit your house the next night to clean it up.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoGuardianAngel">
    <value>You are the "啰哩啰嗦" (longwinded) auntie (Guardian Angel 👼). Each night, you may want to discuss with another resident the prospect of a joint collaboration. If the HDB agents (wolves) find you, your exceptionally fantastic mouth allows you to outspeak the HDB agent to the point that they simply give up and leave you and your friend alone. However, if you try pitching this idea to the HDB agents there is a 50% chance they will evict you because you have definitely broken the law! And don't think about the Pontianak (serial killer); you know better than to anger the resident ghost...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoGunner">
    <value>You are the shady NSF (gunner 🔫)! You somehow managed to smuggle SAF parts home, only to resell them through Tor (to supplement your pathetic allowance). If you hate someone for being noisy (up to 2), you could just go to their flat and shoot them in the head, but the lack of a suppressor means the whole block would hear the gunshot.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoHarlot">
    <value>You are the makcik (Malay for auntie) (harlot 💋). You sell laksa from your home illegally. The residents are more than happy to pay $2.50 for your laksa bowl, but if you try to sell it to the HDB agent (wolf), the law will ensnare you! If the HDB agent visits you while you are not at home, no one will know of your large industrial laksa cauldron, and nothing will happen to you.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoTraitor">
    <value>You are the jealous resident (traitor🖕). When all the HDB agents (wolves) have given up, you take over their job as the next-in-line. The hacktivist (seer) may identify you as either an unhappy envious resident or a HDB agent, so beware!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoWolf">
    <value>YOU ARE AN HDB AGENT (WOLF 🐺)!! XD It's time to decide, once per night, who you want to evict! Down with all the illegal activities in this HDB estate!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoSeer" >
    <value >You are the hacktivist (seer 👳). Each night, you may compromise a resident's network, knowing what the resident's real life is.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoVillager" >
    <value>You are one of those sad residents (villager 👱) who merely gambles away your salary on 4D and being envious over your other residents’ illegal HDB enterprises, but your knowledge of their illegal activity is enough to risk eviction!</value>
    <value>You were hoping to be a good businessman? Nah, you're really just a sad resident (villager 👱) who hopes to make it big in TOTO someday... dan gu gu! (wait long long!)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoTanner" >a
    <value >You are the attention seeker (tanner 👺). If majority of the HDB block wants to chase you away, you spread a conspiracy and plunge the flat prices of your ex-residents!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoWildChild" >
    <value >You are the orphan (wild child 👶). You never quite knew about your origins, except that your foster parents claimed you were picked up from the rubbish bin. However, if they ever leave someday, you'll be abandoned, and may have no choice but to join the HDB to feed yourself!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoBeholder" >
    <value >You are the network snooper (beholder 👁). You know who the real hacktivist is, as opposed to the script kiddie who does not do real damage.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoApprenticeSeer" >
    <value >You are the rogue Computer Science student (apprentice seer 🙇). Someday, if the resident hacktivist (seer) is gone, you must take over to help your fellow residents intercept the goody-two-shoes before they start evicting everyone.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoCultist" >
    <value >You are a Money Lending Member (MLM) (Cultist 👤). Sometimes businesses just need that little more "oomph". Knowing how desperate the estate is for "easy money", the MLM is who they go to, for money, only to be sucked into a pit of no return. (tl;dr: you're just a bloody ah long (loanshark) with a fancy title.)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoCultistHunter" >
    <value >You are the fake CPIB officer (Cultist Hunter 💂). Scaring the MLM is an extremely effective way to earn money. Only the MLM gets frightened with your antics, though; the makcik, hacktivist, among others know better than to fall for your fake CPIB badge.</value>

  </string>
  <string key="SeerEaten" >
    <!-- 0 - victim name -->
    <value>Morning comes, and a notice was pasted at {0}'s door. The Hacktivist (seer) was caught working over-time! Some wire tappers and an old monitor were left in the bulk refuse chute, testament that he was being evicted.</value>
    <value>The advisory reads: {0} has been evicted for installing malware on the HDB servers. Looks like there is no way to further inflate the value of their HDB flat anymore.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="DrunkEaten" >
    <!-- 0 - victim name -->
    <value>The eerie silence spooked the loudest auntie, who woke everyone up, in fears that there were ghosts. Indeed, {0}, the drunkard (drunk) had been caught and evicted. No more smashed Tiger Beer bottles, but also no more regular customer at the Singapore Pools outlet.</value>

  <string key="FoolEaten" >
    <!-- 0 - victim name -->
    <value>The residents wakes up to the smell of burning plastic, only to see the unit of {0} burnt down from an electrical overload! The stupid script kiddie (fool) DDoS-ed himself while the HDB agents were visiting! The HDB agents quickly evicted him on counts of misconduct.</value>

(Don't say you are a money-lending member when you are just a loanshark!)</value>
    <value>Morning comes, and it seems that an MLM, {0}, has left the HDB estate in shame! The "CPIB" has performed a raid and all the neighbours now know the one responsible for the pigs' heads and random blood trails. Ah Long say Ah Long lah! Simi money-lending member?

    <value>HENG ARH! (Lucky us!) Nobody seems to have been evicted last night.</value>
    <value>It appears that no one was evicted last night. Please praise the Father, the Son and the Holy Goh.</value>
    <value>Someone volunteers to perform a headcount. Everyone seems to be present, which is good. Maybe the estate isn't so spooky after all, considering how this place is well-known for "mysterious" evictions.</value>

  <string key="AboutVG">
    <value>Villager? What do you think we are, some happy-go-lucky people?\n \nThis is Singapore! You mean sad HDB resident! (Villager) 👱! While you don't really know what your neighbours are up to, you uphold the BRO CODE: don't paotou (whistle-blow) your neighbours! However, there has been talk of the HDB clamping down on "illegal business" and the MLM spreading its wings! You don't want to have no neighbours left, do you, so stop the HDB agents from evicting your neighbours!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSeer">
    <value>Shhhh! What I do is confidential and highly illegal! *runs a port scanner*\n \nThe Hacktivist (Seer) 👳 is known to pwn networks. Your job of identifying all who threaten your neighbours' illegal activities is so highly-valued that the HDB agents will certainly see you as a prized asset to evict first.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWw">
    <value>Werewolves? Are you really sure? *takes out a dossier of sales papers*\n \nThe HDB Agent (Werewolf) 🐺  is just as brutal, though. They call it "cleansing the HDB block" of all illegal activity, when they are probably just breaking all the bro codes in the HDB block. \nThe rumor is, a Coward will surrender on first sight of the HDB agents.\nBut HDB agents are not invincible; epic litterbugs and drunkands make them much slower at getting to the heart of all these illegal activities, for they must call the Town Council down to clean up!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHarlot">
    <value>Sex? Sorry! I sell other delicious delicacies instead! \n \nThe makcik (Malay for auntie) (Harlot) 💋 that everyone loves!! \nYou sell laksa from your home illegally. The residents are more than happy to pay $2.50 for your laksa bowl, but if you try to sell it to the HDB agent, the law will ensnare you! \nIf the HDB agent visits you while you are not at home, no one will know of your large industrial laksa cauldron, and nothing will happen to you.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDrunk">
    <value>Tiger, Heineken or Guinness... *orders 3 crates of beer* \n \nThe Drunkard (Drunk) 🍻 drinks thrice daily (especially when watching the Barclays Premier League), leaves a trail of alcohol and never cleans up. He is often caught drinking at Bedok Reservoir after 10.30 pm to drown his sorrows with his bad football bets, which is illegal! But the HDB agents must follow your trail, tiring them out for a night if they decide to evict you. Please don't accidentally fall into the reservoir!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCursed">
    <value>Curses, there are none, but cowardice plenty. \n \nYou are the Coward (Cursed) 😾. You have watched how the HDB agents have moved in ever so swiftly each night, looked around and evicted your less-than-obedient neighbours. Thankfully you have consulted a lawyer from Lee and Lee to argue your way into joining the ranks of the HDB agents should they ever come visiting...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTraitor">
    <value>Jealousy has often resulted in the worst betrayals of the bro code...\n \nI heard we have a Jealous Resident (Traitor) 🖕 in our block. He cannot cook like the makcik, smuggle like the shady NSF or hack like the hacktivist. Going for SkillsFuture did nothing to help him. While there are HDB agents still around he hopes to leverage their enforcement to keep their businesses in check, but when they are all gone he may have to do it himself...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGA">
    <value>In every neighbourhood there is always this auntie who can talk for days on end and never run out of saliva or ammunition...\n \nThat's the 啰哩啰嗦 (Long-Winded) Auntie (Guardian Angel) 👼 already. She learnt from the best of the best! Watching Taiwanese dramas such as 爱 (LOVE) on Channel 8 was indeed useful in sounding like a broken record! Having fine-tuned this skill against any smooth-tongued people such as the MLM or anyone from the government, the 啰哩啰嗦 auntie is in high demand, except that she cannot be in two places at one time...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDetective">
    <value>Detective? That's in the times of Sherlock! \n \nIn times of the Smart Nation, we have the Drone Operator (Detective) 🕵 ! Mistrust of the HDB agents have led to many keeping their doors closed, but flying a drone and snooping into flats, while highly illegal, is probably the best way to find out the HDB agents within! Be careful, drones are highly visible, and there is a 40% chance the HDB agents see the drone, antenna, and the smart alec responsible for flying it!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGunner">
    <value>Serving National Service as a full-time national serviceman (NSF) is sometimes a chore, so why not do something with it?\n \nThe Shady NSF (Gunner) 🔫 is a conscript with a very smart head. While his bunkmates prefer "bribing" doctors and acting to get away with MCs, the shady NSF exploits the system to sell valuable equipment through Tor, to supplement his otherwise meagre allowance! He even has a SAR-21 at home, only waiting for an unlucky victim who crosses his path...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTanner">
    <value>You go onto Tinder, Bigo, Instagram, Snapchat e.t.c. in the hope to be famous, but you never have enough followers.\n \nYou are the Attention Seeker (Tanner) 👺. All you know is how to exploit social media for its worst features. If the HDB estate wants you to leave, you won't leave before using your last bits of your dataplan to post conspiracies about the estate on Hardwarezone and EDMW that ghosts exist, among other spooky features. That automatically ruins everyone's day, plunging the price of their flats! The power of social media... in the hands of merely one prickly soul...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutFool">
    <value>While there are hacktivists, there are also stupid script kiddies...\n \nOverconfidence is always in huge supply, and in the Script Kiddie (Fool)🃏 there is aplenty. Just because he has watched some self-hack videos and read articles by someone who has attended DEFCON, he thinks he can hack, when really, he's just pushing traffic onto 127.0.0.1. WHAT A FOOL!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCult">
    <value>Ah, I know what you are thinking about... those buggers hanging pigs' heads while claiming they come from some financial institution.\n \nThere are people who are Money-Lending Members (MLM) (Cultist) 👤! Well, the residents have illegal enterprises that will never get bank loans, so perhaps it's a great income opportunity to speak to them regarding "easy credit".</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCH">
    <value>"The rise in sex scams on WeChat hints that your illegal enterprise, perhaps, should be scamming the scammer"\n \nThe fake Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) Officer (Cult Hunter) 💂 revels in scaring his fellow residents! He does not really have the tools to catch anyone with syndicates, but a pig's head is a dead giveaway. For some fun, visiting them means a MLM gets so frightened he gladly pays up! If the HDB agents ever catch you... you may well be hit by double charges!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWC">
    <value>Where do I come from?\n \nThe orphan (Wild Child) 👶 never had a clue of his origins (maybe the rubbish chute). However, if his foster parents suddenly leave, or get evicted, he'll be all alone, and will have to find a job, especially since his fellow neighbours allowed the travesty of making his foster parents leave...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAppS">
    <value>Ah, the apprentice? The one studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore?\n \nThe rogue Computer Science student (Apprentice Seer) 🙇 has already managed to perform Anonymous-like defacements as part of his "education". Upon graduation, he will take over the Hacktivist and keep his fellow bros safe! He remembers his Civics and Moral Education class on "gratitude", I suppose!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBH">
    <value>Shhhh, he's always monitoring data flows...\n \nYou see, the Network Snooper (Beholder) 👁  knows who the real hacktivist; the script kiddie never seems to be able to get past pinging 127.0.0.1.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMason">
    <value>Beneath the bro code is a deeper code called the "three sisters".\n \nThe Gossip Aunties (Mason) 👷 are always together, sharing the latest juicy gossip about the estate. They gossip about everyone else except themselves, and hence the circle of trust is really just the gossip aunties themselves. </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDG">
    <value>This must be the top student!\n \nI'm talking about the Imitator (Doppelgänger) 🎭. Starting with memorising multiplication tables, he then goes on to memorising the 词语手册 and then onto organic chemistry. Now he's so good; he can essentially live someone's else's life, but that person must first disappear!\nNote: If the original resident was recruited by a MLM, they will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were the Orphan and their foster parents gone, the Imitator will sign up to be an HDB agent. Otherwise, they will inherit their foster parents.\nThe MLM cannot convince the student to think about money (but can after the Imitator switches roles). Also - the Imitator can NOT win unless they have take over a role. If at the end of the game, the Imitator is still the same, they lose (exception: forced marriage).
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCupid">
    <value>You mean arranged marriages are still a thing?! *glares at conservative parents*\n \nThe Matchmaker (Cupid) 🏹 is the witness of an arranged marriage (really, just for the BTO). On command of their parents, they will wed just so that they can help improve Singapore's TFR!\n \nNote: The spouses will know who each other are, but not be told their roles. If the spouses are the last two alive, they win, regardless of teams. If the spouses are on different teams (HDB Agent + MLM), and one team wins (HDB Agent), the lover (MLM) wins as well. TL;DR if both lovers are alive at the end, and at least one of them was on the winning team, they both win together.
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>Wanna know more about someone's dark past? Look for her! \n \nShe is the tape-recording Auntie (Hunter) 🎯. You may think she is just like any housewife, but she knows every single person's history. If the HDB agents try to evict her, she may have a counter-exposé that will humiliate one of them! If they're forced to leave the HDB flat, there is no loss in spilling the beans on someone else anyway.\n \nNote: For HDB agent evictions, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one HDB agent, the tape-recording auntie has a 30% chance to humiliate the HDB agent and survive. For each additional HDB agent, add 20% (2 HDB agents = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple HDB agents, the HDB agents will select one of their counterparts to be the fall guy, and the auntie will still have to be evicted. \nIf the MLM tries to recruit the tape-recording auntie, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, the auntie has a 50% chance to "borrow" on the contact of the CID to arrest him and his pig's head!

  <string key="AboutSK">
    <value>Regardless of race, language or religion, there is always a ghost story or two... \n \nThe one and only PONTIANAK (serial killer) 🔪 used to be human! Since gaining supernatural status, the pontianak has decided to purify the HDB estate, by chasing everyone out! \n \nThey can win only if they are the last player with a HDB flat (exception: forced marriage). If the HDB agents try to harass you to evict you from the flat, you speak so bloody fast that the HDB agents have a four-in-five chance of losing the verbal duel and one of them gets a heart attack instead!</value>

    <value>You are the stock market speculator (Sorcerer 🔮) who prefers to ride on the fortunes of your neighbours to earn a tidy profit for yourself.

    <value>You are the HDB CEO (Alpha Wolf ⚡), the one who started it all. Public housing is public housing and should not be for all these finicky business! However, considering the attrition rate in your organisation, you seek for repentant souls who might see the error in their ways and turn over to your side. (20% chance)

  <string key="AboutWolfCub">
    <value>You are the HDB Scholar (Wolf Cub 🐶). Adored by the HDB CEO, you are considered so valuable that all the HDB agents either look up to you because of your smarts, or are jealous because you're a scholar that will be promoted much faster than any farmer. Once you are out of the picture, however, everyone would want to start impressing their bosses for the next fast-track career vacancy, so the HDB agents will work harder to prove themselves!</value>

    <value>It appears {0}'s computer science skills can no longer be put to the test. The HDB agents found his twiddling with automated DDoS scripts, evicting the Rogue Computer Science student immediately.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="BlacksmithKilled">
    <value>{0}'s superstitions have come true. She predicted last night the Pontianak would eventually find her, and she was right. The Superstitious Auntie has been scared out of her wits, and has decided to pack her bags.</value>

  <string key="CultistKilled">
    <value>The Pontianak has claimed a new victim! {0} tried to go around hanging pigs' heads and spraying O$P$, only to be spooked by the Pontianak!</value>

    <value>The Pontianak has robbed the HDB flat of "love", frightening the Matchmaking Auntie, {0}, out of her wits! No more matchmakers in the HDB flat; time for singles to wait till they are 35 before getting their own BTO!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="DrunkKilled">
    <value>Weird... {0} was enjoying his Tiger Beer when a loud scream was suddenly heard. Apparently the Pontianak has come visiting, spooked him out of his wits, and no amount of alcohol would make him forget the Pontianak! He hastily fled the HDB flat.</value>
    <value>{0} was enjoying a hearty shot of Kavalan (from the Duty Free store) when the Pontianak sobered him up. The drunkard is now leaving the HDB flat for good, scarred at how no amount of whisky can make him ever forget the psychological trauma.</value>

  <string key="GuardianAngelKilled">
    <value>{0} would normally have handled the Pontianak just fine, except that she was out of words tonight. Even as a 啰哩啰嗦 (Long-winded) auntie, {0} decided to cut the crap and just leave this scary HDB flat.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="GunnerKilled">
    <value>Looks like {0} was not doing guard duty right last night! All the HDB residents had found was a trail of urine, an abandoned SAR-21 and a few bullet holes, as if the Pontianak had succeeded in spooking the shady NSF, just like the stories he had heard while in Pulau Tekong.</value>

    <value>The fakery of the Fake Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau Officer, {0}, was exposed. Visiting an apparition last night was so traumatising he had got his just desserts for scaring people with the law. Never visit the Pontianak, especially at night!</value>
