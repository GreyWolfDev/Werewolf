  </string>
  <string key="AboutCH">
    <value>Your job is to hunt the Cult. If the cult attacks you, their newest member will die. Each night you may pick a player to 'hunt' - if they are a cultist, they will die.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWC">
    <value>At the beginning of the game, you will choose someone to be your 'role model'. If they die, you become a werewolf.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAppS">
    <value>For now, you are a normal villager. However, if the seer dies, you will become the new seer</value>

    <value>You will be told who the seer is (the real one, not the fool)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMason">
    <value>A mason's job is simple - they automatically know who the other masons are. Otherwise, they are a simple villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDG">
    <value>
      Your ancestors had the ability to metamorph into others... while you don't have their full abilities, you can pick a player at the start of the game. If that player dies, you will become what they were.
      Note: If the player was converted to cult, you will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were Wild Child and their role model died, you will become a wolf. Otherwise, you will inherit their role model.
      The cult cannot convert the Doppelgänger (but can after the doppelganger switches roles). Also - the Doppelgänger can NOT win unless they have transformed. If at the end of the game, the Doppelgänger is still the same, they lose (exception: lover)
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCupid">
    <value>
      Love is in the air. As Cupid, you will choose two players at the start of the game. These two players will become madly in love! If one of them dies, the other will die of sorrow :(
      Note: Lovers will know who each other are, but not be told their roles. If the lovers are the last two alive, they win, regardless of teams. If the lovers are on different teams (villager + wolf), and one team wins (wolf), the lover (villager) wins as well. TL;DR if at least one of the lovers was on the winning team, they both win together.
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>
      A trigger happy, vindictive player. As the hunter, you try to keep to yourself. However, when others come to visit you, they may find themselves dead, as your paranoia takes hold and you shoot. If the wolves attack you, you have a chance to take one of them with you. Otherwise, if you die, you will get a chance to shoot someone as you die.
      Note: For wolf attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one wolf, the hunter has a 30% chance to kill the wolf (and survive). For each additional wolf, add 20% (2 wolves = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple wolves, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed.
      If the cult tries to convert you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!

  <string key="AboutSK">
    <value>That asylum was silly anyways. What a joke. You are free now however, back to business as usual - killing! The serial killer is a lone player, on their own team. They can win only if they are the last player alive (exception: lovers). As the serial killer, you can kill ANYONE - wolves, hunters, gunners, guardian angels, whatever. If the wolves try to attack you, you will kill one of them (random), and live.</value>

  <string key="RoleInfoMayor">
    <value>You are the Deer (Mayor). Your vote during the lynching will count twice, once you have revealed yourself. You are on the village team.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoPrince">
    <value>You are secretly the Lion (Prince), escaping from your boring, pampered, sex-filled life by spending the day with these kinky peasants (You have a thing for that sort of stuff.) If they try to lynch you, they realize their error, and no one will be lynched.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoClumsyGuy">
    <value>You are the Jackalope(Clumsy Guy): You’ll try to vote, but there is a 50% chance you’ll vote for someone else other than you intended instead, on account of your technically not existing. You’re still on the village team though.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoSorcerer">
    <value>You are the Crow, allying yourself with creatures of the night rather than villagers (They fuck better anyway). At night you will use your power to find the wolves or the Owl. You win only if the wolves win. Enjoy helping fuck over those miserable villagers.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoBlacksmith">
    <value>You are the Bull: the crafter of the village. You have a small amount of toys you've made recently, enough to distract the wolves from fucking someone for one night. During the day, you can choose to spread them around the village. Other than that, you are just a villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoAlphaWolf">
    <value>You are the Alpha Wolf; the source of the scourge. Your bite is the cause of the curse that turns bunnies into werewolves (It's totally the bite and not he fact that you have the best booty in the land... at least that's what you tell the other wolves.) Each night, you will choose a furball to attack and kill, but as long as you are alive, your victim has a 20% chance of turning into a werewolf.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoWolfCub">
    <value>You are the Pack Bitch; Slut of the wolf pack. Like other wolves, you will choose a villager to attack and kill every night. If you happen to be killed, your wolf pack will fly into a fuck-frenzy and fuck two people the next night. You’ll still be out of the game though.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="PrinceLynched">
    <value>As the village begins to lynch {0}, they say “Wait! I am the Prince!" and for proof they reveal both their (growing) mane, and the royal buttplug. "So I cannot be evil.” Feeling foolish, the villagers sheepishly retire for the night.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="SorcererOther">
    <value>You try to look at {0}, but can't quite make out what they are.  They are not a wolf or Owl however...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="MayorReveal">
    <value>{0} steps forward and lifts their hat revealing their antlers revealing they're the deer, and declaring as such.  From now on, {0}'s votes for lynching will count twice.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AskMayor">

  <string key="SpreadDust">
    <value>Would you like to spread your toys around today, disabling the wolves tonight?</value>
  </string>
  <string key="BlacksmithSpreadSilver">
    <value>As the rest of the village debates over the events, they suddenly notice {0} wandering around laying down toys across the grounds.... though they warn it's for the Wolves, not for the public to use.  For now, at least, the village will be safe from wolf attacks, and everyone else can get sloppy seconds. (Wolves are disabled tonight)</value>

  <string key="PlayerBittenWolves">
    <value>As the wolves attack {0}, {1} stops everyone, being the Alpha Wolf.  {1} tells the pack that {0} should join the pack instead of dying, so the pack leaves them to their infection.  They will become a werewolf tomorrow night.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="PlayerBitten">
    <value>You were attacked by the wolves, but the Alpha Wolf chose you.  Instead of being killed, you have been infected..  and will become a wolf tomorrow night!</value>

  <string key="BittenTurned">
    <value>As night falls, you feel a strange tingling, and your body aches as it begins to transform.... You are now a werewolf!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMayor">
    <value>As mayor, you are a lowly villager, until you reveal yourself. Then you are given twice the vote count for lynching (meaning that your vote is twice as powerful as everyone else's). Use that power wisely to help the Village Team.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutPrince">
    <value>The prince is a key role in the Village Team's strategy. Once the prince gets lynched, their role as Prince is revealed, and they survive. However, this can only happen once: if the village insists on lynching them, they will die.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSorcerer">
    <value>Do you remember the good old seer? Well now, it has its Wolf Team counterpart. The sorcerer is the Wuff's Seer. They can only see if someone is Wolf or Seer, and they win with the Wolves.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutClumsy">
    <value>You are the Clumsy Guy. Maybe you should not have had so much alcohol for breakfast. You can't see a damn thing. Can you even vote for the person you want to? (You have a 50% chance to vote for someone random.)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBlacksmith">
    <value>You are the BlackSmith. Through the years, no blades nor swords gave you as much satisfaction as the Silver Blades the elves ordered.\nYou might have some silverdust left. Who knows ? It might *prevent Wolves from eating tonight* 🤔
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAlphaWolf">
    <value>You are the Alpha Wolf, the origin of the curse, the bane of banes. Every night, there's 20% chance that you will bite your pack's meal, and they will join your ranks instead of dying!
