  <string key="AboutCupid">
    <value>
      You are the Chapel Dweller. You will choose two hunters to defend your chapel. If one dies, the other will immediately seek revenge, and die in the process. If they survive together at the end, they will win.\n TL;DR if at least one of the protectors was on the winning team, they both win together.
    </value>

  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>
      You are Gherman, the First Hunter. As the First Hunter, you try to keep to yourself. However, when others come to visit you, they may find themselves dead, as you are crazy to join the hunt. If the beasts attack you, you have a chance to take one of them with you. Otherwise, if you die, you will get a chance to decapitate someone as you die.
      Note: For beast attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one beast, the hunter has a 30% chance to kill the beast (and survive). For each additional beast, add 20% (2 beasts = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple beasts, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed.
      If the covenant of corrupteds tries to convert you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!
