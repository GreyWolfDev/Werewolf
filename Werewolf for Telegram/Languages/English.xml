  <string key="AboutSeer">

    <value>As the harlot (you slut...) you will be given the chance to 'visit' another player each night. If they are not the wolf, you will be told so (because you live!).

However - If you are visiting a player, and the wolves choose to kill you, you will survive (you weren't home)</value>

    <value>As a cultist, it is your goal to convert all other players (except wolves) to your cult. If at the end of the game, all living players are cultist - the cult wins</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCH">
    <value>Your job is to hunt the Cult. If the cult attacks you, their newest member will die. Each night you may pick a player to 'hunt' - if they are a cultist, they will die.</value>

  </string>
  <string key="AboutMason">
    <value>A mason's job is simple - they automatically know who the other masons are. Otherwise, they are a simple villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDG">
    <value>
      Your ancestors had the ability to metamorph into others... while you don't have their full abilities, you can pick a player at the start of the game. If that player dies, you will become what they were.
      Note: If the player was converted to cult, you will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were Wild Child and their role model died, you will become a wolf. Otherwise, you will inherit their role model.
      The cult cannot convert the Doppelgänger (but can after the doppelganger switches roles). Also - the Doppelgänger can NOT win unless they have transformed. If at the end of the game, the Doppelgänger is still the same, they lose (exception: lover)
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCupid">
    <value>
      Love is in the air. As Cupid, you will choose two players at the start of the game. These two players will become madly in love! If one of them dies, the other will die of sorrow :(
      Note: Lovers will know who each other are, but not be told their roles. If the lovers are the last two alive, they win, regardless of teams. If the lovers are on different teams (villager + wolf), and one team wins (wolf), the lover (villager) wins as well. TL;DR if at least one of the lovers was on the winning team, they both win together.
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>
      A trigger happy, vindictive player. As the hunter, you try to keep to yourself. However, when others come to visit you, they may find themselves dead, as your paranoia takes hold and you shoot. If the wolves attack you, you have a chance to take one of them with you. Otherwise, if you die, you will get a chance to shoot someone as you die.
      Note: For wolf attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one wolf, the hunter has a 30% chance to kill the wolf (and survive). For each additional wolf, add 20% (2 wolves = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple wolves, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed.
      If the cult tries to convert you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSK">
    <value>That asylum was silly anyways. What a joke. You are free now however, back to business as usual - killing! The serial killer is a lone player, on their own team. They can win only if they are the last player alive (exception: lovers). As the serial killer, you can kill ANYONE - wolves, hunters, gunners, guardian angels, whatever. If the wolves try to attack you, you will kill one of them (random), and live.</value>

  <string key="RoleInfoMayor">
    <value>You are the Mayor. Your vote during the lynching will count twice, once you have revealed yourself. You are on the village team</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoPrince">
    <value>You are secretly the Prince, escaping from your boring, pampered life by spending the day with these peasants. If they try to lynch you, they realize their error, and no one will be lynched.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoClumsyGuy">
    <value>You are the Clumsy Guy: You’ll try to vote, but there is a 50% chance you’ll vote for someone else other than you intended instead. You’re still on the village team though.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoSorcerer">
    <value>You are the Sorcerer, allying yourself with creatures of the night rather than villagers. At night you will use your power to find the wolves or the Seer. You win only if the wolves win. Enjoy helping snuff out those miserable villagers.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoBlacksmith">
    <value>You are the Blacksmith: the metalworker of the village. You have a small amount of silver, enough to prevent the wolves from attacking for one night. During the day, you can choose to powder it and spread it around the village. Other than that, you are just a villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoAlphaWolf">
    <value>You are the Alpha Wolf; the source of the scourge. Your bite is the cause of the curse that turns humans into werewolves. Each night, you will choose a human to attack and kill, but as long as you are alive, your victim has a 20% chance of turning into a werewolf.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoWolfCub">
    <value>You are the Wolf Cub; adored by your wolf pack. Like other wolves, you will choose a villager to attack and kill every night. If you happen to be killed, your wolf pack will fly into a rage and attack two people the next night. You’ll still be dead though.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="PrinceLynched">
    <value>As the village begins to lynch {0}, they say “Wait! I am the Prince. This royal ring, with the seal of the king proves it. Every night I am surrounded by servants. So I cannot be evil.” Feeling foolish, the villagers sheepishly retire for the night.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="SorcererOther">
    <value>You try to look at {0}, but can't quite make out what they are.  They are not a wolf or seer however...</value>
  </string>

    <value>{0} steps forward and present the official seal of the Mayor, declaring themselves as such.  From now on, {0}'s votes for lynching will count twice.</value>

    <value>As the wolves attack {0}, {1} stops everyone, being the Alpha Wolf.  {1} tells the pack that {0} should join the pack instead of dying, so the pack leaves them to their infection.  They will become a werewolf tomorrow night.</value>

  <string key="AboutMayor">
    <value>As mayor, you are a lowly villager, until you reveal yourself. Then you are given twice the vote count for lynching (meaning that your vote is twice as powerful as everyone else's). Use that power wisely to help the Village Team.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutPrince">
    <value>The prince is a key role in the Village Team's strategy. Once the prince gets lynched, their role as Prince is revealed, and they survive. However, this can only happen once: if the village insists on lynching them, they will die.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSorcerer">
    <value>Do you remember the good old seer? Well now, it has its Wolf Team counterpart. The sorcerer is the Wuff's Seer. They can only see if someone is Wolf or Seer, and they win with the Wolves.</value>

    <value>What a cuuuute little wuff. _tickles tickles_ -cough cough- As i was saying, you are the Wolf Cub and you _drops the mic_ -I just can't resist that. I think if anyone killed you, i'd give the wuffs two victims. You're too cute to die. I wouldn't be able to tickle you anymore-</value>

  <string key="BlacksmithKilled">
    <value>Seems like {0}, the resident blacksmith, must have been extremely unlucky.

Maybe the serial killer was hoping to expand his weapon collection alongside his organ one...</value>

  </string>
  <string key="DrunkKilled">
    <value>The villagers had hoped to meet {0} to compliment his Martell, but all they found in {0}'s home was a broken knife and liver. All those years of drinking led to a liver so hard that even the Serial Killer probably does not fancy it...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="GuardianAngelKilled">
    <value>{0} would normally have managed to fight off the serial killer, but it was an irony that the Guardian Angel's halo has extinguished. {0} is dead.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="GunnerKilled">
    <value>Looks like {0} was caught napping last night! A gunshot was heard last night, but all there was was the remains of a gunner, with a bullet hole to the head and a stab to the torso. Clearly the serial killer has won.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="MayorKilled">
    <value>Assassination! {0} the mayor was found pinned with a knife on the table while working overnight at the mayor office! Clearly it's the serial killer exacting revenge for the asylum robbing him of years of his life!</value>

    <value>{0}'s guards were caught napping last night. The royal remains of {0} were found, hung in various parts of the palace, having fallen prey to the knife. No amount of princely blood would deter a serial killer's blade.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="SeerKilled">
    <value>The villagers wake up to a rotting corpse of {0}, split from head to toe, stabs all over. Strangely the brain was carefully extricated, as if it was a premonition that the village has lost their top brains. {0} was the Seer.</value>

  <string key="WildChildEaten">
    <value>NOMNOMNOMNOM! The wolves were heard last night, eating up a tender Wild Child, {0}, leaving behind only a reduced-size skeleton! The village wondered if the wolves felt any guilt tearing apart the defenceless child.</value>

    <value>The villagers wake up in the morning, only to find the severed body parts of {0}, the Cultist Hunter, in a cart placed in full view outside the town hall. Lesson learnt: don't visit the serial killer!</value>
    <value>The body of {0}, the Cultist Hunter, was found in the middle of town, albeit cut precisely into a hundred pieces. Checking if the Serial Killer was a cultist does not seem to be a good idea...</value>

  <string key="CultConvertWolfPublic"> <!--used when Cultists convert the wolves, only if wolves stayed home-->
    <value>While it seemed that the wolves decided to stay good for once, punishing {0}, a cultist that decided to court trouble with the wolves, proved too difficult to resist. {0}'s head was converted to a fine supper, delivered to the wolves' doorsteps!</value>
    <value>The cult ran into unexpected trouble last night. Their newest member had the misfortune of visiting a wolf on the night the wolves decided to stay home, and the wolf found {0} quite delicious. Unfortunately for {0}, wolves have no interest in joining the new religious movement.</value>

  <string key="CultConvertKillerPublic"> <!--used when Cultists convert the SK-->
    <value>The cult thought they would have a new member in their ranks, but they were wrong! {0}, a cultist, was minced to pieces and placed at the town square in the morning! Strangely their "holy" book was found stabbed with a knife, as if a statement to show whose religion was triumphant.</value>
    <value>Last night, the cult tried to convert the one person in the village crazier than they are. Their newest member tried to convert the Serial Killer, and the Serial Killer made a new piece of art in the town square of {0}'s internal organs.</value>

  <string key="GAGuardedKiller"> <!-- used when GA guards SK -->

  </string>
  <string key="GAGuardedWolf"> <!-- used when GA guards a wolf -->
    <value>{0} tried to guard a wolf last night. The town woke up to find only the wings of {0} hung on the church cross. Clearly the wolves had an extra meal god-sent, free-of-charge, to their homes.</value>
