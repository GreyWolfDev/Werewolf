  <string key="AboutVG">
    <value>
	Every player is a furry, able to vote every day to try to lynch the bunnies' enemies (or their own...), but some people are nothing other than bunnies! In that case, they won't have any actions for the whole game (other than the lynch vote), and their deaths will only make a difference as another number.
	
	NO ACTIONS, ever!
  Rolenames: Villager/Bunny</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSeer">
    <value>
	The Owl may choose a player every night, and will find out their role once morning comes. Careful when revealing what you've found out to others, though: lots of people in the villager want an owl dead... Trust no one, not even yourself: you may be the derp! (/aboutfool) When looking at the Mongrel, there's a 50% chance of seeing them as either a villager or a wolf.
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!
  Rolenames: Owl/Seer</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWw">
    <value>
	 Every night, all wolves in the pack vote to decide who to attack. Not all players should be attacked, though!
	 The newest wolf in a pack will be killed if the Wasp is attacked, and may be killed if the target is the Bear (30% chance for a sole wolf to die - and not be able to kill the Hunter! - and an additional 20% chance for the newest wolf to die for each additional wolf in the pack!)
	 All wolves will get disabled if they attack the Poison frog, and won't be able to do any actions the next night!
	 <!--EDIT HERE HERE what are roles that won't be home? ayylmao-->The Fox probably won't be home, so the night will be wasted if you try to attack them!
	 Good news, though: if you attack the husky, they will become a wolf along with you! If you kill a Lemur's rolemodel, they will also become a wolf!
	 \nIf you attack the drunk, you yourself will become drunk, and will be unable to do the next attack as you sleep off your hangover! (Usually, this means you can't attack the following night, but if the Wolf Cub was killed and the Drunk was your first choice, you won't be able to kill the second player, and you will still be able to attack the following night.)
	 
	 NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!
  </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHarlot">
    <!-- hunter! ayylmao -->
	<value>
	The Harlot will be given the chance to visit another player each night. They will notice something happened, even if they don't remember what. The harlot dies if they visit a wolf or the Serial Killer, so visiting is a good way to find safe players, even if it's as a sacrifice! The harlot will also die if they visit a house attacked by the wolves or if the Serial Killer chooses to kill them! When visiting a cultist, the harlot has a 50% chance of finding out their role!
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDrunk">
    <value>
	The Drunk is just like a villager... Except when they're killed by wolves! Then the wolves will become drunk too, and unable to attack next time!
	
	NO ACTIONS, ever!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCursed">
    <value>
	The Cursed is just like a villager... Until they're attacked by the wolves! Then they become a wolf as well, and join the pack!
	
	NO ACTIONS, until their role changes!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTraitor">
    <value>
	The Traitor is just like a villager... Until all wolves die! Then they take over the mantle and become a werewolf, ready to attack the furries! When the Seer looks at the Traitor, there's a 50% chance of the traitor appearing as either a villager or a wolf.</value>
	
	NO ACTIONS, until their role changes!
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGA">
    <value><!--what's the chance for SK to kill GA? 50% wolf ayylmao-->
	The Guardian Angel can choose one player each night to protect from attacks, either from wolves or the Serial Killer. However, if they choose to protect one of those they should protect from, they may be killed!
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!
	</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDetective">
    <value>
	Every day, the Detective can choose a player to investigate, and will find out what their role is. There is a 40% chance the werewolves will see the Detective investigating someone, though!
	
	DAY ACTIONS, every day!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGunner">
    <value>
	During the day, the Gunner will be given the chance to shoot (and kill!) another player. The whole village will know who did it, so they will (probably) not lynch the Gunner, knowing they're on the furries' side! There are only two bullets on their gun, though...</value>
	
	DAY ACTIONS, but it can only be used twice!
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTanner">
    <value>
	The Tanner is just like a villager... But if they're lynched, they win the game!
	
	NO ACTIONS, ever!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutFool">
    <value>
	The Fool has no way of knowing they aren't actually the Seer... When choosing a player to find out their role, they will instead get told a random role out of all roles of alive players.
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCult">
  <!-- CULT CONVERSION RATES AND WHO'S HOME HERE! ayylmao -->
    <value>
	Every night, all cultists in the cult vote to decide who to convert. The cult wins when every single alive player is a cultist. It's not that simple to convert players, though!
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCH">
    <value>
	The Cultist Hunter has a single job: kill all cultists. Every night, they get to visit a player, who won't feel anything... unless they are a cultist, in which case, the Cultist Hunter will kill them! If the cult chooses to convert the CH, their newest member dies.
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWC">
    <value>
	The Wild Child chooses a player as their rolemodel during the first night of the game. Once their role model dies, the Wild Child becomes a werewolf!
	
	FIRST NIGHT ACTION, then none until their role changes!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAppS">
    <value>
	The Apprentice Seer is just like a villager... Until the Seer dies, in which case, they will become the new Seer!
	
	NO ACTIONS, until their role changes!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBH">
    <value>
	The Beholder is just like a villager, but, if there's a Seer in the game, they will be told their name. If the Seer dies and the Apprentice Seer and/or the Doppelgänger become Seer, the Beholder will also be told!
	
	NO ACTIONS, but they do get information!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMason">
    <value>
	A mason is just like a villager, except they will always know who the other masons are! If a mason is converted to the cult, all other masons will be told!
	
	NO ACTIONS, but they do get information!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDG">
    <value>
      The Doppelgänger chooses a player during the first night of the game. Once they die, the Doppelgänger will become what they were! Unless the player was converted to the cult, the Doppelgänger will become what they were at the time of death! When becoming a Wild Child, the Doppelgänger will inherit their role model. The Doppelgänger cannot be converted to a cultist until they change roles, and will not be able to win (except as a lover) unless they've changed roles!
      
	  FIRST NIGHT ACTION, then none until their role changes!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCupid">
    <value>
      The Cupid will choose two players at the start of the game and make them fall in love with each other. If one of them dies, the other will die of sorrow... If one of them is on the winning team at the end of the game, both will be winners! If the only players left standing are the Lovers, they will be the winners! The Cupid can choose themselves as one of the Lovers.
	  
	  FIRST NIGHT ACTIONS, then none!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>
      The Hunter is just like a villager... Until someone visits them, or they die! Anyone who visits the Hunter's house will find themselves dead (other than the cult - there's a 50% chance the cult will convert the Hunter, and then a 50% chance a cultist will be killed if the conversion fails), unless they go there to attack the Hunter. The Serial Killer will be able to kill the Hunter, and a pack of wolves will also be able to do that... However, the Hunter won't go down without a fight! When they're killed - be it by lynching or a murder, but not a wolf attack - the Hunter will be given a choice to shoot and kill someone out of the players alive!
	  Wolf attacks work differently, though! If a sole wolf attacks the hunter, there's a 30% chance they'll be able to kill the wolf and survive. Otherwise, the Hunter will be killed by the wolves, but may be able to take one down (instead of choosing a player to kill) as they go! For two wolves, the chance of killing one of them is 50%. For three, it's 70%; for four, 90%, and for packs with five wolves or more, the Hunter will definitely be able to kill one of them as they die!
	  
	  NO ACTIONS, until they die!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSK">
    <value>
	The Serial Killer can choose a player every night to attack and kill. They win if they're the last one alive! There's no one that can't be killed by the Serial Killer, and visiting their house isn't a good idea, since everyone who tries will die... Serial Killers can only be killed by being lynched or shot (by the Gunner or the Hunter).
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!</value>

  <string key="AboutPara">
    <value>
	Para is a silly developer that likes to bark at people.  Maybe he's been messing with werewolves too long....Messing with werewolves is a very bad idea.

    <value>Seems like {0}, the resident bull, must have been extremely unlucky.

    <value>Last night, the snake tried to convert the one person in the village crazier than they are. Their newest member tried to convert the wasp, and the wasp made a new piece of tentacle art in the town square of what was remaining of the snake {0}</value>
