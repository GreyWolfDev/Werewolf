      Baze Malbus 🎯 \nYou are Baze Malbus, a former guardian of the Jedi Temple of Kyber.  You carry a big gun, and if you die, you can choose someone else to kill. If you are blasted by the empire, you have a chance to take a Stormtrooper down, but will not be able to choose a player to kill.
      Note: For Empire attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one empire, the Baze has a 30% chance to kill the Empire (and survive). For each additional Empire, add 20% (2 Empire = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple Empire, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed.
      If the Sith cult tries to convert you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!
