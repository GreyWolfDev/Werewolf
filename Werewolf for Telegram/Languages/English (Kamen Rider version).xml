  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>You know every Rider’s powers, sometimes better than they know the powers themselves! \n \nYou are Kamen Rider Decade 

(Hunter) 🎯. Everyone fears you because you have a little dirt on everyone’s powers. If anyone attacks or even approaches you, there is a chance you can take one of them down with you.\n \nNote: For Kaijin, the chance to take them out starts at 30%. If there is one Kaijin, you have a 30% chance to 

defeat the Kaijin and survive. For each additional Kaijin, add 20% (2 Kaijins = 50%, 3 = 70%, 

etc). However - if there are multiple Kaijins, the Kaijins will select one of their counterparts to be 

the fall guy, and you will still be overwhelmed. \nIf a Shocker Grunt tries to recruit you, he has a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to eliminate him.

decided to purify the world.. By destroying it! \n \nThey can win only if they are the last player (exception: They’re half of Kamen Rider W). If the Kaijins try to attack you, they have a four-in-five chance of losing the battle and getting eliminated!</value>
