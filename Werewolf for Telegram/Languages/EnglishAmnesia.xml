  <string key="AboutVG">
    <value>
	Every player is a villager, able to vote every day to try and lynch the village's enemies (or their own...), but some people are nothing other than villagers! In that case, they won't have any actions for the whole game (other than the lynch vote), and their deaths will only make a difference as another number.
	
	NO ACTIONS, ever!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSeer">
    <value>
	The Seer may choose a player every night, and will find out their role once morning comes. Careful when revealing what you've found out to others, though: lots of people in the villager want a Seer dead... Trust no one, not even yourself: you may be the fool! (/aboutfool) When looking at the Traitor, there's a 50% chance of seeing them as either a villager or a wolf.
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWw">
    <value>
	 Every night, all wolves in the pack vote to decide who to attack. Not all players should be attacked, though!
	 The newest wolf in a pack will be killed if the Serial Killer is attacked, and may be killed if the target is the Hunter (30% chance for a sole wolf to die - and not be able to kill the Hunter! - and an additional 20% chance for the newest wolf to die for each additional wolf in the pack!)
	 All wolves will get drunk if they attack the Village Drunk, and won't be able to do any actions the next night!
	 <!--EDIT HERE HERE what are roles that won't be home? ayylmao-->The Harlot probably won't be home, so the night will be wasted if you try to attack them!
	 Good news, though: if you attack the cursed, they will become a wolf along with you! If you kill a Wild Child's rolemodel, they will also become a wolf!
	 \nIf you attack the drunk, you yourself will become drunk, and will be unable to do the next attack as you sleep off your hangover! (Usually, this means you can't attack the following night, but if the Wolf Cub was killed and the Drunk was your first choice, you won't be able to kill the second player, and you will still be able to attack the following night.)
	 
	 NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHarlot">
    <!-- hunter! ayylmao -->
	<value>
	The Harlot will be given the chance to visit another player each night. They will notice something happened, even if they don't remember what. The harlot dies if they visit a wolf or the Serial Killer, so visiting is a good way to find safe players, even if it's as a sacrifice! The harlot will also die if they visit a house attacked by the wolves or if the Serial Killer chooses to kill them! When visiting a cultist, the harlot has a 50% chance of finding out their role!
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDrunk">
    <value>
	The Drunk is just like a villager... Except when they're killed by wolves! Then the wolves will become drunk too, and unable to attack next time!
	
	NO ACTIONS, ever!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCursed">
    <value>
	The Cursed is just like a villager... Until they're attacked by the wolves! Then they become a wolf as well, and join the pack!
	
	NO ACTIONS, until their role changes!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTraitor">
    <value>
	The Traitor is just like a villager... Until all wolves die! Then they take over the mantle and become a werewolf, ready to attack the villagers! When the Seer looks at the Traitor, there's a 50% chance of the traitor appearing as either a villager or a wolf.</value>
	
	NO ACTIONS, until their role changes!
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGA">
    <value><!--what's the chance for SK to kill GA? 50% wolf ayylmao-->
	The Guardian Angel can choose one player each night to protect from attacks, either from wolves or the Serial Killer. However, if they choose to protect one of those they should protect from, they may be killed!
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!
	</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDetective">
    <value>
	Every day, the Detective can choose a player to investigate, and will find out what their role is. There is a 40% chance the werewolves will see the Detective investigating someone, though!
	
	DAY ACTIONS, every day!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGunner">
    <value>
	During the day, the Gunner will be given the chance to shoot (and kill!) another player. The whole village will know who did it, so they will (probably) not lynch the Gunner, knowing they're on the villagers' side! There are only two bullets on their gun, though...</value>
	
	DAY ACTIONS, but it can only be used twice!
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTanner">
    <value>
	The Tanner is just like a villager... But if they're lynched, they win the game!
	
	NO ACTIONS, ever!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutFool">
    <value>
	The Fool has no way of knowing they aren't actually the Seer... When choosing a player to find out their role, they will instead get told a random role out of all roles of alive players.
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCult">
  <!-- CULT CONVERSION RATES AND WHO'S HOME HERE! ayylmao -->
    <value>
	Every night, all cultists in the cult vote to decide who to convert. The cult wins when every single alive player is a cultist. It's not that simple to convert players, though!
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCH">
    <value>
	The Cultist Hunter has a single job: kill all cultists. Every night, they get to visit a player, who won't feel anything... unless they are a cultist, in which case, the Cultist Hunter will kill them! If the cult chooses to convert the CH, their newest member dies.
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWC">
    <value>
	The Wild Child chooses a player as their rolemodel during the first night of the game. Once their role model dies, the Wild Child becomes a werewolf!
	
	FIRST NIGHT ACTION, then none until their role changes!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAppS">
    <value>
	The Apprentice Seer is just like a villager... Until the Seer dies, in which case, they will become the new Seer!
	
	NO ACTIONS, until their role changes!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBH">
    <value>
	The Beholder is just like a villager, but, if there's a Seer in the game, they will be told their name. If the Seer dies and the Apprentice Seer and/or the Doppelgänger become Seer, the Beholder will also be told!
	
	NO ACTIONS, but they do get information!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMason">
    <value>
	A mason is just like a villager, except they will always know who the other masons are! If a mason is converted to the cult, all other masons will be told!
	
	NO ACTIONS, but they do get information!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDG">
    <value>
      The Doppelgänger chooses a player during the first night of the game. Once they die, the Doppelgänger will become what they were! Unless the player was converted to the cult, the Doppelgänger will become what they were at the time of death! When becoming a Wild Child, the Doppelgänger will inherit their role model. The Doppelgänger cannot be converted to a cultist until they change roles, and will not be able to win (except as a lover) unless they've changed roles!
      
	  FIRST NIGHT ACTION, then none until their role changes!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCupid">
    <value>
      The Cupid will choose two players at the start of the game and make them fall in love with each other. If one of them dies, the other will die of sorrow... If one of them is on the winning team at the end of the game, both will be winners! If the only players left standing are the Lovers, they will be the winners! The Cupid can choose themselves as one of the Lovers.
	  
	  FIRST NIGHT ACTIONS, then none!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>
      The Hunter is just like a villager... Until someone visits them, or they die! Anyone who visits the Hunter's house will find themselves dead (other than the cult - there's a 50% chance the cult will convert the Hunter, and then a 50% chance a cultist will be killed if the conversion fails), unless they go there to attack the Hunter. The Serial Killer will be able to kill the Hunter, and a pack of wolves will also be able to do that... However, the Hunter won't go down without a fight! When they're killed - be it by lynching or a murder, but not a wolf attack - the Hunter will be given a choice to shoot and kill someone out of the players alive!
	  Wolf attacks work differently, though! If a sole wolf attacks the hunter, there's a 30% chance they'll be able to kill the wolf and survive. Otherwise, the Hunter will be killed by the wolves, but may be able to take one down (instead of choosing a player to kill) as they go! For two wolves, the chance of killing one of them is 50%. For three, it's 70%; for four, 90%, and for packs with five wolves or more, the Hunter will definitely be able to kill one of them as they die!
	  
	  NO ACTIONS, until they die!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSK">
    <value>
	The Serial Killer can choose a player every night to attack and kill. They win if they're the last one alive! There's no one that can't be killed by the Serial Killer, and visiting their house isn't a good idea, since everyone who tries will die... Serial Killers can only be killed by being lynched or shot (by the Gunner or the Hunter).
	
	NIGHT ACTIONS, every night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutPara">
    <value>
	Para is a silly developer that likes to bark at people.  Maybe he's been messing with werewolves too long....Messing with werewolves is a very bad idea.

  </string>
  <string key="BlacksmithKilled">
    <value>Seems like {0}, the resident blacksmith, must have been extremely unlucky. Five knives, fresh from {0}'s armory, were found plunged into his hands, feet and head, and pinned to the craftsman's table last night. Maybe the serial killer was hoping to expand his weapon collection alongside his organ one...</value>

  </string>
  <string key="DrunkKilled">
    <value>The villagers had hoped to meet {0} to compliment his Martell, but all they found in {0}'s home was a broken knife and liver. All those years of drinking led to a liver so hard that even the Serial Killer probably does not fancy it...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="GuardianAngelKilled">
    <value>{0} would normally have managed to fight off the serial killer, but it was an irony that the Guardian Angel's halo has extinguished. {0} is dead.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="GunnerKilled">
    <value>Looks like {0} was caught napping last night! A gunshot was heard last night, but all there was was the remains of a gunner, with a bullet hole to the head and a stab to the torso. Clearly the serial killer has won.</value>

    <value>Assassination! {0} the mayor was found pinned with a knife on the table while working overnight at the mayor office! Clearly it's the serial killer exacting revenge for the asylum robbing him of years of his life!</value>

    <value>{0}'s guards were caught napping last night. The royal remains of {0} were found, hung in various parts of the palace, having fallen prey to the knife. No amount of princely blood would deter a serial killer's blade.</value>

  <string key="SeerKilled">
    <value>The villagers wake up to a rotting corpse of {0}, split from head to toe, stabs all over. Strangely the brain was carefully extricated, as if it was a premonition that the village has lost their top brains. {0} was the Seer.</value>

  <string key="WildChildEaten">
    <value>NOMNOMNOMNOM! The wolves were heard last night, eating up a tender Wild Child, {0}, leaving behind only a reduced-size skeleton! The village wondered if the wolves felt any guilt tearing apart the defenceless child.</value>

    <value>The cult ran into unexpected trouble last night. Their newest member had the misfortune of visiting a wolf on the night the wolves decided to stay home, and the wolf found {0} quite delicious. Unfortunately for {0}, wolves have no interest in joining the new religious movement.</value>

    <value>The cult thought they would have a new member in their ranks, but they were wrong! {0}, a cultist, was minced to pieces and placed at the town square in the morning! Strangely their "holy" book was found stabbed with a knife, as if a statement to show whose religion was triumphant.</value>
    <value>Last night, the cult tried to convert the one person in the village crazier than they are. Their newest member tried to convert the Serial Killer, and the Serial Killer made a new piece of art in the town square of {0}'s internal organs.</value>

  <string key="GAGuardedKiller"> <!-- used when GA guards SK -->

  <string key="GAGuardedWolf"> <!-- used when GA guards a wolf -->

Looking at the sight of the corpses strewn all across the village, {0} sighs. Their lifelong dream of being chosen to be lynched by the villagers is as dead as the villagers are. They reach out and touch the rope, that had taken many lives, tenderly, before slipping it around their neck and letting themselves hang freely, with a sad smile on their face.</value>
    <value>{0} wakes up at dawn, alone. {0} sees how abject a failure they has been, not being able to get the village to satisfy their masochistic desires of being lynched to death. {0} grabs a rope and hangs himself, realising no one can accomplish their dream, since there is no one left.</value>

A tear slips from their eye, as {0} recalls how close they and their wolves were to victory. Alas, it was time to start a new life, with a new pack. {0} slips into the darkness of the forest, away from the quiet village.</value>
    <value>For all of {0}'s efforts, {0}'s wolf friends lay motionless and lifeless. Even if the wolves have been brought victory, there is no one to savour the success with, neither are there any living villagers to mock at. {0} peers into the crystal ball, and silently disappears, in a cloud of fog, in search of new wolves, new allies, and new treachery to commit new crimes against humanity.</value>

But since you are out at night, the wolves or the serial killer might spot and kill you, and the more graves you have to dig, the more likely it is.
