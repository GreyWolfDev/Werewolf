  <string key="AboutVG">
    <value>Villager? What do you think we are, some rural hicks? *sips whiskey*\n \nI think you mean Mafia Soldier (Villager) üë±! A simple footsoldier for the Fairview Famiglia, they only take orders from the higher-ups without knowing who they are. Today, they have one mission: doing their best protecting the Godfather from the cops!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSeer">
    <value>Psst! Not so loud! I won't risk my family for you! *inhales cigars*\n \nThe Torture Technician (Seer) üë≥ is one of the most important guy in the Famiglia. Their job is to "extract information" about a citizen's true allegiance, without them knowing, of course. For that reason, they make the most valuable target for the police!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWw">
    <value>Werewolves? Are you right in your head? *polishes Tommy gun*\n \nThe Police Officer (Werewolf) üê∫ from F.P.D. is just as feral, though. They vow to get rid of mafia in their "beloved" neighborhood, one scum at a time. Every day, they have to blend in with other mafia and try not to be exiled. Each night, they can choose to arrest someone.\nThe rumor is, a Repentant Mafia will surrender and join their ranks if the Police raid their house at night.\nThey still need to watch their steps in front of the Politician. If anything happens to the Politician's spouse, they will guard their funeral the next night and there won't be any chance for a raid.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHarlot">
    <value>I wish there's someone that sexy in this city... *whistles*\n \nI've got the Middleman (Harlot) üíã for my other fixes! They've got the good stuff and will sell them for a price. Every night, they deliver the contrabands to a citizen. \nI really wish that they don't happen to be visiting a raid target. The police is sure to grab them to the jail with all the illegal stuffs they have. \nLuckily, since the Middleman is always on the road, the Police won't meet them in their house if they're out selling something to someone.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDrunk">
    <value>I need a drink too... *orders 3 shots of whiskey* \n \nThe Politician (Drunk) üçª knows his his booze. A politician on mafia's payroll, they keep a high status in Fairview. However corrupt they are, the town will honor them a night of mourning for their or their family's death. Let's hope nothing happens if the police decided to raid them...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCursed">
    <value>Of course nobody is cursed here... *fidgets with a bullet*\n \nBut I've heard someone is a Repentant Mafia (Cursed) üòæ. They have been afraid with their criminal life's consequences, and ready to leave it for good whenever the cops come for you. If the police decided to raid their house, they say they will surrender and join their ranks, able to join the raid every night!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTraitor">
    <value>Now don't tell anybody I tell you this... *looks around nervously*\n \nI heard we have a Double Agent (Traitor) üñï in our Famiglia. They lay low to hide their true allegiance, but if their cop friends are dead or missing, they will come out and continue the police's work!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGA">
    <value>I met an angel once, in that hotel 'round the corner. *sports reminiscing looks*\n \nBut I think you might've heard of the Bouncer (Guardian Angel) üëº already. Every night, they guard a citizen's house. Between their imposing build and a truck full of knives, pistols, machine guns, and every other weapon conceivable (yes, that include a knife-shooting machine gun... long story), the police won't risk a firefight and will abandon the raid if the Bouncer happened to be guarding their target. However, if they choose to guard a cop's house, there's a 50% chance the cop will notice their truck and arrest them!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDetective">
    <value>Detective? You mean the snooping and tiptoeing around kind? *flips a coin*\n \nThe Stalker (Detective) üïµ is our next best thing, kiddo. This creep may be a creep, but they are a creep on our payroll. During the day, they may stalk a player to reveal their true allegiance. But there is a 40% chance the cops will find them stalking around them! Their stalking is one of the most hated activities by cops here, you can be sure this creep has a target on their back.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGunner">
    <value>We all have our guns, don't we? *juggles a few bullets*\n \nThe Paparazzi (Gunner) üî´ is just as mean without a gun, though. Although on the Godfather's payroll, they can't resist a big scoop. They are an expert on exposing dirts on everyone who lives here. The shame they can bring to any citizen... it can be unbearable and will always force the exposed citizen to leave city. The Newspaper only have 2 (two) spots for him though.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTanner">
    <value>Yes, isn't this leather pistol holder neat? *shows their pistol around*\n \nBy the way, watch out for the Suicide Bomber (Tanner) üë∫. When the city gives up on them, they will also give up on the city, and detonate the bomb they planted everywhere. They try their best to make people vote to exile them to reach the greatest reward: a big kaboom!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutFool">
    <value>You know who's the real fool? *glares menacingly*\n \nNot you, but that gossiper! They think they are a great source of info, and goes around town gossiping about anybody. They even acts like our Technician. However, their sources can't really be trusted and they just accuse anybody randomly!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCult">
    <value>Ah, I know what you are thinking about... *smiles mischievously*\n \nAs for me, I'm thinking of those Church of Happyology (Cultist) üë§! They say they only want everyone, mafia or not, chill and worship their deity. I say they are embezzling our city's treasury and our Family's wealth.\n \nI actually see one of them visiting someone every other night, recruiting everybody they meet to their little club. The city will be surely gone if everybody follow their lead.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCH">
    <value>That bloke huh? They are on our payroll, too... *squints unexpectedly*\n \nThe local IRS Officer (Cult Hunter) üíÇ is tasked to battle tax embezzlement by the Feds. The godfather informed them that the Church of Happyology are embezzling tax from the City, so the Agent is in good standing with us... for now.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWC">
    <value>Aren't you THE wild one, asking all this questions? *hums a sweet tune*\n \nYou remind me of the Idealist (Wild Child) üë∂. Always a do-gooder, that kid, never to lose hope on humanity. Even with a scum like me, he tried to make me "mend my ways." Got it from their parents, I suppose. I just hope nothing bad happens to their parent. It's the only thing preventing him to become a police officer, you see.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAppS">
    <value>Ah, the apprentice? Yeah, we got a creepy kid for that. *shudders*\n \nYou know them, the Tech Assistant (Apprentice Seer) üôá. They never "extract information" by yourself, but if the Technician is nowhere to be found, they will be hired to do the "extracting" as well!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBH">
    <value>We don't say their name out loud here... *continues in whispers*\n \nYou see, the Consigliere (Beholder) üëÅ is Godfather's right hand man. They employ a "personal advisor" to "extract information". That's the Torture Technician!\n \nThat Gossip poser? They are beneath the Consigliere notice. Likewise for the Assistant, unless the Torture Technician is indisposable and they need another "information extraction" specialist.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMason">
    <value>Of course I know them. They are good guys. Great even. *grins*\n \nThey are the Caporegime (Mason) üë∑, a Mafia Captain! They say they are the only ones at mafia meeting, so they know other Caporegime as well. They don't have their own assistants, though.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDG">
    <value>That little thief. That's my third wallet this week. *growls angrily*\n \nI'm talking about the ID Thief (Doppelg√§nger) üé≠. Starting as a simple pickpocket, they realize that they can easily fool the city into tricking that they are the person in any identity card you have. Of course, they can only use the identity when the original is not in town.\nNote: If the original ID owner was converted to the Church of Happyology, they will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were the Idealist and their parents disappeared, the Thief will become a police. Otherwise, they will inherit their parents.\nThe Church of Happyology cannot convert the ID Thief (but can after the Thief switches roles). Also - the ID Thief can NOT win unless they have take over a role. If at the end of the game, the ID Thief is still the same, they lose (exception: lover).
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCupid">
    <value>Another do-gooder huh? At least they're on our side. *glances to the direction of the church*\n \nThe Pastor (Cupid) üèπ is the witness of an (un)holy matrimony and true love. As wedded spouse, the two before them will not leave one's side, in shame or in jail.\n \nNote: Lovers will know who each other are, but not be told their roles. If the lovers are the last two alive, they win, regardless of teams. If the lovers are on different teams (Mafia + Police), and one team wins (Police), the lover (Mafia) wins as well. TL;DR if both lovers are alive at the end, and at least one of them was on the winning team, they both win together
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>Oh yeah, my house is built by them. The best contractor in town. *talks normally*\n \nThey? They are the Construction Worker (Hunter) üéØ. They may look like nothing special, but they know every weakness in every building in the city. The policeman will be incapacitated if they try to raid the Worker's trap-laden house. If they're forced to leave the city, someone's house will pay.\n \nNote: For police attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one police, the Construction Worker has a 30% chance to incapacitate the police officer (and survive). For each additional officers, add 20% (2 polices = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple police officers, while the Worker may kill one of them, they will still be outnumbered and arrested. \nIf the Church of Happyology tries to convert the Construction Worker, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, the Worker have a 50% chance to trap one of them!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSK">
    <value>I thought they are only an urban legend... *hunchs instinctively*\n \nThe Kidnapper (Serial Killer) üî™ is the nightmare of the city. Kidnapping people without demanding any ransom, they do this every night just for giggles. They throw a people in your dungeon every night, and they say perhaps they want to open their own museum later! \n \nThey can win only if they are the last player alive (exception: lovers). As the Kidnapper, they can kidnap ANYONE - Mafia, Police, Bouncer, Pastor, whatever. If the police raid your home, they will kidnap one of them instead (random), and live.</value>
