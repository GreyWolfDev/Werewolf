  </string>
  <string key="AboutSeer">
    <value>You are the Seer. Each night, you may choose a player, and have their role revealed to you. Admit to your role wisely: If you reveal you are the seer, the wolves will try to kill you!</value>

  <string key="AboutWw">
    <value>You get to have fun! Each day, you will attempt to decieve your fellow players. However, each night, you will get to pick a player to kill!\nNote: If you attack the cursed, they will become a wolf like yourself! Hooray friends!\nIf you attack the drunk, you yourself will become drunk, and will be unable to do the next attack as you sleep off your hangover! (Usually, this means you can't attack the following night, but if the Wolf Cub was killed and the Drunk was your first choice, you won't be able to kill the second player, and you will still be able to attack the following night.) </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHarlot">
    <value>As the harlot (you slut...) you will be given the chance to 'visit' another player each night. If they are not the wolf, you will be told so (because you live!). If you visit a wolf, you will be killed. If you visit the player the wolves have chosen to kill, you will be killed as well. However - If you are visiting a player, and the wolves choose to kill you, you will survive (you weren't home)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDrunk">
    <value>You drunken bastard! As the drunk, you are still just a villager. BUT! If the wolves kill you, they will become disabled for the next kill, as they are drunk off your insanely high BAC.</value>

  </string>
  <string key="AboutGA">
    <value>You are the Guardian Angel! Each night, you may choose a player to watch over. Be careful however - if you choose to watch over a wolf, there is a 50% chance you will be killed.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDetective">
    <value>You old sleuth. Each day, you will have the chance to investigate another player. Use this carefully however, for these is a 40% chance the werewolves will detect you!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGunner">
    <value>A bit trigger happy are we? As the gunner, you are given 2 silver bullets at the beginning of the game. Each day, you will have the chance to shoot another player. Once you do, everyone will know you are the gunner! Be careful though, you only have 2 bullets!</value>

  <string key="AboutTanner">
    <value>The Tanners goal is simple: Get Lynched. If the Tanner gets lynched, he wins, period. Everyone else loses.</value>

    <value>he fool is told they are the seer.... when they choose to see someone's role at night, they are told a random role.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCult">
    <value>As a cultist, it is your goal to convert all other players (except wolves) to your cult. If at the end of the game, all living players are cultist - the cult wins</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCH">
    <value>Your job is to hunt the Cult. If the cult attacks you, their newest member will die. Each night you may pick a player to 'hunt' - if they are a cultist, they will die.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWC">
    <value>At the beginning of the game, you will choose someone to be your 'role model'. If they die, you become a werewolf.</value>

  <string key="AboutAppS">
    <value>For now, you are a normal villager. However, if the seer dies, you will become the new seer</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBH">
    <value>You will be told who the seer is (the real one, not the fool)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMason">
    <value>A mason's job is simple - they automatically know who the other masons are. Otherwise, they are a simple villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDG">
    <value>
      Your ancestors had the ability to metamorph into others... while you don't have their full abilities, you can pick a player at the start of the game. If that player dies, you will become what they were.
      Note: If the player was converted to cult, you will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were Wild Child and their role model died, you will become a wolf. Otherwise, you will inherit their role model.
      The cult cannot convert the Doppelgänger (but can after the doppelganger switches roles). Also - the Doppelgänger can NOT win unless they have transformed. If at the end of the game, the Doppelgänger is still the same, they lose (exception: lover)
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCupid">
    <value>
      Love is in the air. As Cupid, you will choose two players at the start of the game. These two players will become madly in love! If one of them dies, the other will die of sorrow :(
      Note: Lovers will know who each other are, but not be told their roles. If the lovers are the last two alive, they win, regardless of teams. If the lovers are on different teams (villager + wolf), and one team wins (wolf), the lover (villager) wins as well. TL;DR if at least one of the lovers was on the winning team, they both win together.
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>
      A trigger happy, vindictive player. As the hunter, you try to keep to yourself. However, when others come to visit you, they may find themselves dead, as your paranoia takes hold and you shoot. If the wolves attack you, you have a chance to take one of them with you. Otherwise, if you die, you will get a chance to shoot someone as you die.
      Note: For wolf attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one wolf, the hunter has a 30% chance to kill the wolf (and survive). For each additional wolf, add 20% (2 wolves = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple wolves, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed.
      If the cult tries to convert you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSK">
    <value>That asylum was silly anyways. What a joke. You are free now however, back to business as usual - killing! The serial killer is a lone player, on their own team. They can win only if they are the last player alive (exception: lovers). As the serial killer, you can kill ANYONE - wolves, hunters, gunners, guardian angels, whatever. If the wolves try to attack you, you will kill one of them (random), and live.</value>

  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoPrince">
    <value>You are secretly the Prince, escaping from your boring, pampered life by spending the day with these peasants. If they try to lynch you, they realize their error, and no one will be lynched.</value>

    <value>You are the Clumsy Guy: You’ll try to vote, but there is a 50% chance you’ll vote for someone else other than you intended instead. You’re still on the village team though.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoSorcerer">
    <value>You are the Sorcerer, allying yourself with creatures of the night rather than villagers. At night you will use your power to find the wolves or the Seer. You win only if the wolves win. Enjoy helping snuff out those miserable villagers.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoBlacksmith">
    <value>You are the Blacksmith: the metalworker of the village. You have a small amount of silver, enough to prevent the wolves from attacking for one night. During the day, you can choose to powder it and spread it around the village. Other than that, you are just a villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoAlphaWolf">
    <value>You are the Alpha Wolf; the source of the scourge. Your bite is the cause of the curse that turns humans into werewolves. Each night, you will choose a human to attack and kill, but as long as you are alive, your victim has a 20% chance of turning into a werewolf.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="RoleInfoWolfCub">
    <value>You are the Wolf Cub; adored by your wolf pack. Like other wolves, you will choose a villager to attack and kill every night. If you happen to be killed, your wolf pack will fly into a rage and attack two people the next night. You’ll still be dead though.</value>

  <string key="PrinceLynched">
    <value>As the village begins to lynch {0}, they say “Wait! I am the Prince. This royal ring, with the seal of the king proves it. Every night I am surrounded by servants. So I cannot be evil.” Feeling foolish, the villagers sheepishly retire for the night.</value>

  <string key="AboutPrince">
    <value>The prince is a key role in the Village Team's strategy. Once the prince gets lynched, their role as Prince is revealed, and they survive. However, this can only happen once: if the village insists on lynching them, they will die.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSorcerer">

  <string key="BlacksmithKilled">
    <value>Seems like {0}, the resident blacksmith, must have been extremely unlucky.

  <string key="DrunkKilled">
    <value>The villagers had hoped to meet {0} to compliment his Martell, but all they found in {0}'s home was a broken knife and liver. All those years of drinking led to a liver so hard that even the Serial Killer probably does not fancy it...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="GuardianAngelKilled">
    <value>{0} would normally have managed to fight off the serial killer, but it was an irony that the Guardian Angel's halo has extinguished. {0} is dead.</value>

  <string key="GunnerKilled">
    <value>Looks like {0} was caught napping last night! A gunshot was heard last night, but all there was was the remains of a gunner, with a bullet hole to the head and a stab to the torso. Clearly the serial killer has won.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="MayorKilled">

  <string key="SeerKilled">
    <value>The villagers wake up to a rotting corpse of {0}, split from head to toe, stabs all over. Strangely the brain was carefully extricated, as if it was a premonition that the village has lost their top brains. {0} was the Seer.</value>

  <string key="WildChildEaten">

    <value>The cult ran into unexpected trouble last night. Their newest member had the misfortune of visiting a wolf on the night the wolves decided to stay home, and the wolf found {0} quite delicious. Unfortunately for {0}, wolves have no interest in joining the new religious movement.</value>

    <value>Last night, the cult tried to convert the one person in the village crazier than they are. Their newest member tried to convert the Serial Killer, and the Serial Killer made a new piece of art in the town square of {0}'s internal organs.</value>

  <string key="GAGuardedWolf">
    <!-- used when GA guards a wolf -->

    <value>For all of {0}'s efforts, {0}'s wolf friends lay motionless and lifeless.

	<value>You are the Grave Digger ☠️. Every night, you dig the graves for all the people who died since the last time you did (yes, even werewolves deserve a proper burial). Since you are out all night, wolves and the cult can't find you, unless you actually have nothing to do (i.e. no one died), in that case you'll just stay home. Everyone who visits you has a chance of falling into your newly dug graves, depending on how many graves you dug. Also, the chance is halved for everyone who is on the village team with you. But since you are out at night, the wolves or the serial killer might spot and kill you, and the more graves you have to dig, the more likely it is. Also, apparently the serial killer can find you whether you're at home or not, but he might at least stumble in one of your graves and hurt his leg, causing him to maybe lose control over who is his victim the next night...</value>
