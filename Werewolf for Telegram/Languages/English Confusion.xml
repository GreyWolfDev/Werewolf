  <!-- ALL ROLEINFO -->
  <string key="RoleInfoCursed">
	<value>You are cursed. You are a villager at this time, but if the wolves choose to kill you, you will become a werewolf yourself.</value>
	<value>You are the detective. During the day, you may choose a player to reveal their role.  However - in doing so, your role could be revealed to the wolves! (40% chance)</value>
    <value>Congrats! You're the village drunk! (and really, everyone knows it...)</value>
    <value>You are the Guardian Angel. Each night, you may choose a player to save.  However, if you choose a wolf, there is a 50% chance you will die.</value>
    <value>You are the gunner.  You have two bullets.  During the day, you may choose to shoot another player. Everyone will here the shots, and know you are the gunner (not a wolf).</value>
    <value>You slut! You are the Harlot. During the night, you may choose to visit another player, to verify that they are not a wolf.  However--if you visit a wolf, or visit someone killed by the wolf, you will die.  If you do go to visit though, and the wolf tries to kill you at your home, you will survive.</value>
    <value>Traitor! For now, you are a villager, but once all the wolves die, you will become a werewolf.  If the seer looks to you, you may or may not be identified as a wolf.</value>
    <value>YOU ARE A WOLF!! XD (good on ya) Each night you can choose to kill someone.</value>
    <value >You are the seer.  Each night, you may choose a player to 'see', and reveal their role to you.</value>
    <value >You are a lowly villager, doomed to spend your days plowing a field and get eated.</value>
    <value >You are the tanner.  If you get lynched, you win automatically!</value>
    <value >You are a wild child! Pick a player to be your 'role model' - if they die, you become a werewolf.</value>
	<value >You are the beholder, you will be told who the (real) seer is - that is your only function.</value>
	<value >You are the apprentice seer.  If the (real) seer dies, you will take their place as the seer.</value>
	<value >You are a cultist.  Every night, you may choose a player to convert to a cultist. If all remaining living players at the end are cultists, they win.</value>
	<value >You are the Cultist Hunter, trying to stop the cult in town from converting everyone!  Each night, choose a player.  If they are a cultist, they die.  If the cult tries to convert you, the cult's newest member dies.</value>
	<value>You are a Mason.  If there are any other masons, you will know who they are.  Otherwise, you are a villager.</value>
	<value>You are Cupid. Sent to Earth with only underpants, a bow and two arrows, you get to choose two players to love each other for eternity. If one of them dies, the other one dies of sorrow.</value>
	<value>You are a Doppelgänger. Legend has it that your ancestors were metamorphs, and could choose any form they wanted. You have inherited some of their capacities. Choose a player, when that player dies, you will take on their role.</value>
	<value>You are the town Hunter. You do not sleep well, and you would never go to bed without your rifle. If you die, you can choose someone else to kill. If you are eaten, you have a chance to take a werewolf down, but will not be able to choose a player to kill.</value>
	<value>You are the serial killer. Recently escaped from the local asylum, your goal is for everyone else to die. Every night, you can add a player's body to your collection.</value>
	<value>You are the Mayor. Your vote during the lynching will count twice, once you have revealed yourself. You are on the village team.</value>
    <value>You are secretly the Prince, escaping from your boring, pampered life by spending the day with these peasants. If they try to lynch you, they realize their error, and no one will be lynched.</value>
    <value>You are the Clumsy Guy: You’ll try to vote, but there is a 50% chance you’ll vote for someone else other than you intended instead. You’re still on the village team though.</value>
    <value>You are the Sorcerer, allying yourself with creatures of the night rather than villagers. At night you will use your power to find the wolves or the Seer. You win only if the wolves win. Enjoy helping snuff out those miserable villagers.</value>
    <value>You are the Blacksmith: the metalworker of the village. You have a small amount of silver, enough to prevent the wolves from attacking for one night. During the day, you can choose to powder it and spread it around the village. Other than that, you are just a villager.</value>
    <value>You are the Alpha Wolf; the source of the scourge. Your bite is the cause of the curse that turns humans into werewolves. Each night, you will choose a human to attack and kill, but as long as you are alive, your victim has a 20% chance of turning into a werewolf.</value>
    <value>You are the Wolf Cub; adored by your wolf pack. Like other wolves, you will choose a villager to attack and kill every night. If you happen to be killed, your wolf pack will fly into a rage and attack two people the next night. You’ll still be dead though.</value>
	<value>You are a lowly villager, but since you spend most of your time in the woods where there are real wolves, the Seer will get confused and think you are a werewolf! Oh no....</value>
	<value>You are the lycan!  You are a wolf, but the seer will be confused and see you as a villager :)</value>
	<value>You are the Oracle.  Each night you can choose to look at someone, but you will only be able to see what they are NOT.  You will be given a role of someone else in the game that is still alive, so pay attention to what role is said, that means one is still alive :)</value>
	<value>You are the sandman.  Once per game, you can use your magic to put everyone into such a deep sleep, they won't be able to use their role at night.</value>
	<value>You are the Pacifist ☮️. You can choose to convince everyone in your village not to lynch anyone. This can only be done once.</value>
	<value>You are the Wise Elder 📚. You can survive a werewolf attack once - the second time they can eat you up. If the Gunner or Hunter kill you with their abilities, they will lose their powers out of sorrow and will be converted to a normal villager.</value>
	<value>You are the Thief 😈! You can steal a player's role on the first night and turn that player into a villager!</value>
	<value>You are the Thief 😈! Since the [Full Thief] mode is turned on, you get 50% chance to steal a player's role every night, if successful, that player will become the new thief and continues with the theft!</value>
	<value>You are the Troublemaker 🤯. As the teenager in the village, you're on the verge of puberty. One day, when you feel especially annoyed by everything, you can cause a huge furor and the village will lynch twice that day.</value>
	<value>You are the chemist 👨‍🔬! Your love for poisonous potions is huge and as a hobby you like to gamble with your life... Just a bit! You brew two potions, one of them being poisonous, the other neutral, looking exactly the same. Every other night, you can choose a player and force them to have a drink with you, maybe they are lucky and survive. However, if your host chooses the good drink, you'll get the poisonous one and die. Good luck!</value>
	<value>You are the Snow Wolf 🐺☃️. Every night, instead of following your pack to hunt someone, you skulk around on your own to freeze someone out of your pack. A frozen person will be unable to use any night actions, if they have any. However, your victim will have some residue of your power the next night and can not be frozen a second time in a row.</value>
	<value>You are the Augur 🦅. You have the power to see things, but quite different from the seer or the oracle. You are the only one who can see roles that are not in the village, and not even see one of them twice!</value>
	<value>You are the Arsonist 🔥. Each night, you may either douse a house with kerosene or spark, burning all previously doused houses. You can only win if you are the only survivor.</value>
	<value>You are the Grave Digger ☠️. It is your responsibility to get rid of the villages' dead bodies. You dig a grave for everyone who was killed since last night. However, you usually get too tired to finish the grave, so it remains uncovered. Some visitors might fall in and die... At least, the wolves can't eat you since you are out all night.</value>

  </string>
  <string key="AboutWC">
    <value>At the beginning of the game, you will choose someone to be your 'role model'. If they die, you become a werewolf.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAppS">
    <value>For now, you are a normal villager. However, if the seer dies, you will become the new seer</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBH">
    <value>You will be told who the seer is (the real one, not the fool)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMason">
    <value>A mason's job is simple - they automatically know who the other masons are. Otherwise, they are a simple villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDG">
    <value>
      Your ancestors had the ability to metamorph into others... while you don't have their full abilities, you can pick a player at the start of the game. If that player dies, you will become what they were.
      Note: If the player was converted to cult, you will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were Wild Child and their role model died, you will become a wolf. Otherwise, you will inherit their role model.
      The cult cannot convert the Doppelgänger (but can after the doppelganger switches roles). Also - the Doppelgänger can NOT win unless they have transformed. If at the end of the game, the Doppelgänger is still the same, they lose (exception: lover)
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCupid">
    <value>
      Love is in the air. As Cupid, you will choose two players at the start of the game. These two players will become madly in love! If one of them dies, the other will die of sorrow :(
      Note: Lovers will know who each other are, but not be told their roles. If the lovers are the last two alive, they win, regardless of teams. If the lovers are on different teams (villager + wolf), and one team wins (wolf), the lover (villager) wins as well. TL;DR if at least one of the lovers was on the winning team, they both win together.
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>
      A trigger happy, vindictive player. As the hunter, you try to keep to yourself. However, when others come to visit you, they may find themselves dead, as your paranoia takes hold and you shoot. If the wolves attack you, you have a chance to take one of them with you. Otherwise, if you die, you will get a chance to shoot someone as you die.
      Note: For wolf attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one wolf, the hunter has a 30% chance to kill the wolf (and survive). For each additional wolf, add 20% (2 wolves = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple wolves, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed.
      If the cult tries to convert you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSK">
    <value>That asylum was silly anyways. What a joke. You are free now however, back to business as usual - killing! The serial killer is a lone player, on their own team. They can win only if they are the last player alive (exception: lovers). As the serial killer, you can kill ANYONE - wolves, hunters, gunners, guardian angels, whatever. If the wolves try to attack you, you will kill one of them (random), and live.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutPara">
    <value>Para is a silly developer that likes to bark at people.  Maybe he's been messing with werewolves too long....Messing with werewolves is a very bad idea.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMayor">
    <value>As mayor, you are a lowly villager, until you reveal yourself. Then you are given twice the vote count for lynching (meaning that your vote is twice as powerful as everyone else's). Use that power wisely to help the Village Team.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutPrince">
    <value>The prince is a key role in the Village Team's strategy. Once the prince gets lynched, their role as Prince is revealed, and they survive. However, this can only happen once: if the village insists on lynching them, they will die.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSorcerer">
    <value>Do you remember the good old seer? Well now, it has its Wolf Team counterpart. The sorcerer is the Wuff's Seer. They can only see if someone is Wolf or Seer, and they win with the Wolves.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutClumsy">
    <value>You are the Clumsy Guy. Maybe you should not have had so much alcohol for breakfast. You can't see a damn thing. Can you even vote for the person you want to? (You have a 50% chance to vote for someone random.)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBlacksmith">
    <value>
      You are the BlackSmith. Through the years, no blades nor swords gave you as much satisfaction as the Silver Blades the elves ordered.\nYou might have some silverdust left. Who knows ? It might *prevent Wolves from eating tonight* 🤔
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAlphaWolf">

 </string>
  <string key="AboutWolfCub">
    <value>What a cuuuute little wuff. _tickles tickles_ -cough cough- As i was saying, you are the Wolf Cub and you _drops the mic_ -I just can't resist that. I think if anyone killed you, I'd give the wuffs two victims. You're too cute to die. I wouldn't be able to tickle you anymore-</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWolfMan">
    <value>You are a lowly villager, but since you spend most of your time in the woods where there are real wolves, the Seer will get confused and think you are a werewolf! Oh no....</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutLycan">
    <value>The lycan is a wolf, but will appear to be a villager to the seer</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutOracle">
    <value>The oracle will be told what role someone is NOT, choosing from roles that are still alive in the game</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSandman">
    <value> Once per game, the sandman can make all players sleep so deeply that nobody can use their night actions</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutPacifist">
    <value>The Pacifist can choose to convince everyone in your village not to lynch anyone. This can only be done once.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWiseElder">
    <value>The Wise Elder 📚 can survive a werewolf attack once - the second time they can eat you up. If the Gunner or Hunter kill you with their abilities, they will lose their powers out of sorrow and will be converted to a normal villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutThief">
    <value>By default, the Thief 😈 can steal a player's role on the first night and turn that player into a villager.\nIf the [Full Thief] mode is turned on, they get 50% chance to steal a player's role every night, if successful, that player will become the new thief and continues with the theft!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutTroublemaker">
	<value>The Troublemaker is the raging teenager in town. When they start yelling, the whole village gets out of control. To gain silence, they will lynch twice that day!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutChemist">
	<value>The chemist is a quite crazy person who likes to brew potions and mess up with them. They mix two potions and force other people to choose one to drink, while the chemist will drink the other. However, while one solution is just tasting like rosebuds, the other one is going to kill you instantly. Good luck when they visit you!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSnowWolf">
    <value>The Snow Wolf 🐺☃️ is an wolf that was native to the snowcapped mountains near the village. As such, they have mastered the art of controlling ice and snow. Having lived alone for a long time, the Snow Wolf prefers to operate alone. Instead of hunting with their pack at night, they can pick a separate victim to freeze, which causes them to be unable to use their night actions. However, they will still have some residue of the Snow Wolf's magic the next night, causing them to be immune to the Snow Wolf for one night. </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutGraveDigger">
	<value>You are the Grave Digger ☠️. Every night, you dig the graves for all the people who died since the last time you did (yes, even werewolves deserve a proper burial). Since you are out all night, wolves and the cult can't find you, unless you actually have nothing to do (i.e. no one died), in that case you'll just stay home. Everyone who visits you has a chance of falling into your newly dug graves, depending on how many graves you dug. Also, the chance is halved for everyone who is on the village team with you. But since you are out at night, the wolves or the serial killer might spot and kill you, and the more graves you have to dig, the more likely it is. Also, apparently the serial killer can find you whether you're at home or not, but he might at least stumble in one of your graves and hurt his leg, causing him to maybe lose control over who is his victim the next night...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutArsonist">
	<value>You are the arsonist. Like the serial killer, you are alone on your team. Every night, you may douse one targets house with kerosene. Once one or more houses are doused, you may choose to spark instead, burning all doused houses and killing everyone that is inside, including potential visitors. You win if you're the only one left.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAugur">
	<value>You are the Augur 🦅. Every morning, you watch the birds and deduce a role that certainly is not in the game right now from their flight. They also will never tell you a role twice, so be sure you make use of that information!</value>

From the corner of your eyes, you saw the bottles of your potions frosted over. Looks like they didn't escape the brunt of the freezing spell either. You mentally sighed, wishing the sun came up sooner... Good thing you're thawed now, though</value>
    <value>As you donned your cloak and prepared to leave your house, a gust of wind blew in from the doorway, causing you to freeze 🐺☃️. Your fellow cultists dropped by soon after to bring you along to cult people, but they ended up laughing at your demise.
